# Web Development Reference

**Web Development Reference** is a demo project designed to showcase best practices in modern web development. This project serves as a practical guide for developers to learn and apply concepts such as microservices, React, GraphQL, and clean architectural decisions. By exploring a fully implemented system, developers can see these concepts in action, making it easier to understand compared to isolated examples.

## Project Overview

The application demonstrates:
- **Microservices architecture**
- **React** for building the front-end interface
- **GraphQL** for querying and managing data
- **Git strategy** a structured Git workflow for clean, maintainable code

## Purpose

This project is intended to serve as a reference for good code practices in web development. It aims to help developers understand real-world implementations of key technologies by providing a full-fledged example to study and follow.

## Getting Started

Setup instructions and more details will be added as the project evolves.

Stay tuned for future updates!
